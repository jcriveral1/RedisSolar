# RedisSolar
Redis + Python Development Course

Redis + Python Development Course
Lesson 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
Course Overview
In this course, we'll build RediSolar - a complete solar energy monitoring application using Python, Flask, and Redis. This real-world project will teach you how to:

Connect to Redis from Python applications
Model domain data using Redis data structures
Implement common Redis patterns (caching, rate limiting, leaderboards)
Use Redis TimeSeries for time-based data
Build geospatial features with Redis
Optimize performance with pipelining and Lua scripts

What We're Building: RediSolar
RediSolar is a solar power monitoring application that consists of three main components:

Backend API (Python + Flask + Redis)
Frontend Dashboard (Vue.js with charts and maps)
Data Ingestion System (For real-time meter readings)

The application will handle:

Solar site management and tracking
Real-time energy production monitoring
Geospatial queries for site locations
Performance analytics and leaderboards
Rate-limited API access


Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Python 3.8+ installed (we'll use 3.8 for consistency)
Basic knowledge of Python, web development concepts
Familiarity with REST APIs
Understanding of basic database concepts
